dotfiles
========

The dotfiles of the magnificent Addison Omead Amiri. Respected by few and
feared by fewer. Each of the folders should have a script that sets up symlinks
in your home folder to each of the files in the cloned repo. That is if you for
some reason would like to keep your dotfiles to my specifications. Automate
runs all the symlink scripts.
