│  Each of the folders should have a shell script in them to create symlinks   │
│  in your home folder. Shit should work but no promises. I am still new to    │
│  intracacies of shell scripting. As to why they're zsh scripts it's just to  │
│  give you a bit of a hassle for using a sub-par shell. Change the #!'s and   │
│  they'll work fine.                                                          │
